                  In all other respects, GST will be payable by the Shipper to
                  NEXUS upon the same basis as the GST exclusive consideration
                  is payable by the Shipper under these Conditions.
                </li>
                <li>
                  NEXUS will issue an invoice or Invoices to the Shipper for the
                  amount of GST referrable to the Taxable Supply. NEXUS will
                  include in any such Invoice the particulars that are required
                  by the GST Law so that the Shipper may obtain an input tax
                  credit for the amount of GST payable on the Taxable Supply.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If any part of the consideration is referrable to both a
                  Taxable Supply and anything that is not a Taxable Supply, the
                  amount of GST payable by the Shipper will be determined by
                  NEXUS and will be the same amount of GST that would be payable
                  if the Taxable Supply were the only Supply made to the
                  Shipper.
                </li>
                <li>
                  If the Shipper defaults in making any payment to NEXUS
                  pursuant to this Agreement, then without prejudice to any
                  other remedies of NEXUS, the Shipper will pay to NEXUS upon
                  demand an amount equal to the amount of any Damages or
                  interest or additional GST that may become payable by NEXUS
                  arising out of the default of the Shipper.
